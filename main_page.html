        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        
        <h4>When will you be graduating from SDSU?</h4>
        <p> 
            <ul>
                I'm currently in my final semester of SDSU. 
                I will be graduating in the next upcoming months in May of 2025. 
            </ul>
        
        <h4>What do you have planned after graduation?</h4>
        
            <ul>
                Once I have my Bachelors in Art Multimedia and away from academia. 
                I will be searching for a job with decent pay. 
                I also want to complete a few personal art and writing projects.
            </ul>
        
        <h4>What program do you prefer to use?</h4>
        
            <ul>
                Depends on what I'm working with. If I want to do photomanipulations and editing,
                I prefer to use Photoshop. If I'm working on animation or digital comics, 
                I prefer to use Clip Studio Paint.
            </ul>
        
        <h4>What work are you most proud of? Why?</h4>
        
            <ul> 
                I used to be terrible with backgrounds, using gradients or characters in a white void.
                My current favorite has a red and gray color palette of an artifical zoo, with the foreground
                having two of my original characters facing off. It's not in my gallery since it's not a commission. 
            </ul>

            <li>A friend of mine wanted a landscape done of one of the pictures she'd taken on a trip
                up to South Dakota, with the addition of a river. It took me about two days at the time, 
                since I was relatively new to backgrounds, but she was confident that I could pull it off.
