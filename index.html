        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        
        <h4>When will you be graduating from SDSU?</h4> 
            <ul>
                I'm currently in my final semester of SDSU. 
                I will be graduating in the next upcoming months in May of 2025. 
            </ul>
        
        <h4>What do you have planned after graduation?</h4>
        
            <ul>
                Once I have my Bachelors in Art Multimedia and away from academia. 
                I will be searching for a job with decent pay. 
                I also want to complete a few personal art and writing projects.
            </ul>
        
        <h4>What program do you prefer to use?</h4>
        
            <ul>
                Depends on what I'm working with. If I want to do photomanipulations and editing,
                I prefer to use Photoshop. If I'm working on animation or digital comics, 
                I prefer to use Clip Studio Paint.
            </ul>
        
        <h4>What work are you most proud of? Why?</h4>
        
            <ul> 
                I used to be terrible with backgrounds, using gradients or characters in a white void.
                My current favorite has a red and gray color palette of an artifical zoo, with the foreground
                having two of my original characters facing off. It's not in my gallery since it's not a commission. 
            </ul>

                Based on the memory of a cross country trip from California to North Dakota and back
                for my grandmother. It was nice to see wide fields of yellow grass and the snowcapped
                mountains in the distance, and she wanted a memento.

                    Created for a youtube influencer's minecraft series in 2019. Dedicated to parkour, I wanted to 
                    get those old school early 2000's skateboarding videos, and utilized a fish-eye lense at ground level.
